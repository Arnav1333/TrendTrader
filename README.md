## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Django  
- **Backend**: Python

## 🧠 Project Overview

Stock price prediction is a complex challenge due to:

- High volatility  
- Non-linearity  
- External market influences

Traditional models often struggle to capture intricate dependencies, and stochastic methods may fail to adapt to evolving trends. 

To address these limitations, we propose a **hybrid modeling approach** that combines:

- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks  
- **Attention mechanisms**  
- **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**

### 🔍 Key Features

- **LSTM with Attention-Enhanced Recurrent Optimization (ARO)**:  
  Captures long-term dependencies and improves focus on relevant time steps in the data.

- **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**:  
  Simulates price fluctuations using stochastic processes for probabilistic modeling.

- **Hybrid Prediction Framework**:  
  Merges the predictive strength of deep learning (LSTM + Attention) with stochastic simulations (GBM) to enhance overall robustness and accuracy.

## 📊 Outcome

By blending LSTM-ARO predictions with GBM-generated trajectories, this project demonstrates improved forecasting performance and better adaptability to complex market behaviors.
